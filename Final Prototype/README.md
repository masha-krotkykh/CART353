// Tamagotchi 2.0

The initial idea behind this project was to create a virtual pet -- version of Tamagotchi for those (now adults) who used to have one in their childhood and would want to re-live this experience in their adulthood.
However I must admit that my Tamagotchi turned out quite childish and has a big potential for further development into desired experience.

It is supposed to have both nostalgic and entertaining value. It is simple and satisfying to take care of a virtual pet without having to commit to having a real one. 
Tamagotchi must be fed and played with in order to stay in a good mood and in a good health. If Tamagotchi gets hungry, he gets sad, if he is neglected for too long he gets mad and scary as well as his surroundings. 
If no actions are performed he falls asleep. If he is too bored and too hungry, he dies. There are two mini games user can play to entertain and train his pet, which also helps him grow.

My main interest in this project was to try and model behaviourial patterns for a virtual entity, make it responsive to user's actions or absence thereof. After working on it I understood that when modeling
a behaviour it is necessary to take a lot of different factors into account, if behaviours are concurrent or consecutive, caused or simply followed by the others, exclude or complement each other. 

The most important coding techniques used for creation of this project were OOP, Array Lists, Inheritance, Vectors, and Forces. The most important part of the interface design creation was the Sprites Library that took some time to research and 
implement. Also using JSON object to store current progress and state of Tamagotchi makes it possible to come back to it and find it in the same condition without having to start over. All this is meant to create a certain bond between user and their pet.
Although I find that sprite animation brought the character to life, Tamagotchi 2.0 definitely needs more diverse and complex behaviour in order to be able to appeal to more mature audience which will be the next step in my research-creation.
Another step would be to migrate Tamagotchi 2.0 online with the help of p5.
In my view the best thing about choosing this kind of project is that it can be built upon almost endlessly -- new behaviours can be added, new games implemented, enemies introduced, new types of food offered, etc.
